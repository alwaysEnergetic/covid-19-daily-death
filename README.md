## Description
A COVID-19 tracker that visualizes the statistics of COVID-19 data provided by the [COVID Tracking Project API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api).

## COVID Tracking Project API
The documentation of the API used is linked [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/SzS8rjHv?version=latest#dc323eaa-826d-4efc-bd3c-85d9d757477b).  

## Running Project Locally
There is the live site of this application deployed on Heroku as displayed on one of the first few lines of this README, but if you would rather run this application locally, then do the following:

* First clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/KennethNguyen/COVID19-US-tracker
```

* Then go into the cloned project directory
```
cd COVID19-US-tracker
```

* In the cloned project directory, install any required dependencies and then run the project
```
npm install
npm start
```
By default, npm start will tell you to navigate to localhost:3000 (or another local server if port 3000 is occupied) on your browser to see the application
